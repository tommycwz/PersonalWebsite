          <h3>Education</h3>
          <h5>Irvine Valley College (Jan 2017 – May 2019)</h5>
          <p>Irvine Valley College (IVC) is an exquisite community college that located in Irvine, California. In the end 2016, I traveled approximately 20 hours from Malaysia to California myself to start my new journey for my higher education. In IVC, I took some basic courses for my major and most of the general education courses that are needed to graduate. After Spring 2019, I bid farewell to this lovely city and head to Baton Rouge, LA to continue my education.</p>
          <h5>Louisiana State University (Aug 2019 – May 2021)</h5>
          <p>Louisiana State University (LSU) is an University that has an incredible passion for College Football. Whenever the football season starts, I can feel the hypes circulating the whole campus even that I am not a huge football fans. In LSU, I take mostly Computer Science courses because I took most of the needed general education course in IVC. My knowledge for my major improve significantly in LSU. At May 2021, I graduate from this university with a Software Engineer degree.</p>

          <h3>Work Experience</h3>
          <h5>SBT Software Solution (Internship for Summer 2018)</h5>
          <p>During Summer 2018, I went back to Malaysia for an internship while having a break from my education. It was an exceptional internship where I learn how a real-life full-stack company works. During this internship, I was assigned to work on a hybrid application for a company. This application is to allow the company’s employee to file their claims and register their sick leave. This hybrid app was done in Ionic 3 framework, AngularJS, and Typescript. As a novice programmer, my knowledge of this job is impossible without any guidance. Therefore, my assignment for that time was mainly learning basic stuff like HTML, CSS, AngularJS, and learn how a hybrid app works. However, I got the chance to work on practical stuff in the project like setting up input forms for the employee to enter their information for their claims. The main thing that I have taken away from this work experience is none other than how a programming company works in the real world. It is a wonderful experience for a fresh programmer like me.</p>
